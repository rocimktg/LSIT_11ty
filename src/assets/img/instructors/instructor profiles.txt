Let's create a instructors.html page.

Utilize the same hero band from the programs page, go ahead and copy the same image background for now.

Let's put together an single instructor profile card. 

1) It will include a portrait of the instructor
2) Their Title
3) Their current belt rank
4) Two 3:1.5 action photos stacked on top of each other (use placeholder boxes for now) on the right hand size of the card (50%)
5) The biography should take the left side of the card
6) A single instructor photo (should go on top, with their titles) use master_k_profile.jpg

Use clean UX/UI principles to implement, should be mobile friendly. Reference the locations&schedules page heavily to pick up on styles.

Utilize the same styling from .card on the locations & schedules page.  There's quite a bit of copy, and I also want to include
